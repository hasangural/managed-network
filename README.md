## What‚Äôs In This Document
This document is intended  to explain custom Terraform Module for using Managed Network purpose. It will deploy fully configured and ready to use compliance virtual network for any purpose of using it. 

You can create a virtual network with this module. Also you can manage these resources;

*   DNS Settings on the Virtual Network
*   Subnet creation on the Virtual Network
*   NSG creation on the Virtual Network
*   URDs creation on 
*   DDoS protection attachment on the Virtual Network
*   Network Watcher Flow Logs and Traffic Analytics Settings on the Virtual Network
*   Diagnostics logging for the Virtual Network
*   Diagnostics logging for the each Sub-Networks
*   Diagnostics logging for the Network Security Groups

Reference the module to a specific version (recommended):
```hcl

    module "AzNetwork" {

    source = "./modules/Az.Network/0.0.1"
    #version = "0.0.1"

    ServiceId             = var.ServiceId
    EnvironmentInstanceId = var.EnvironmentInstanceId
    InstanceId            = var.InstanceId

    Region                = var.Region
    vNetworkSettings      = var.vNetworkSettings
    vSubnetsSettings      = var.vSubnetsSettings

}
```
